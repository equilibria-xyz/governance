const PROPOSAL_TEXT = `# Enabling Cheaper L1 / L2 Wrapping
## Background
Currently, wrapping and unwrapping USDC to and from DSU is gas cost prohibitive in the Empty Set protocol. These operations require performing a Compound mint or redeem internally so that no USDC sits idle in the Empty Set reserve contract. This ensures a trustless mechanism, however it comes at the expense of extremely high gas costs for these operations (approx. 250,000 - 275,000).

#### L2 Extensibility
In addition to the high gas costs on L1, there is no feasible way to wrap / unwrap directly on L2. Currently, DSU must be bridged to an L2 before it can be used there, making it less accessible and increasing its volatility around the peg.

## Trusted Borrowing
We propose adding a new feature to the Empty Set reserve called *Trusted Borrowing* which allows the Empty Set DAO to front DSU to programmatically-trusted contracts, which are able to ensure that they can repay the fronted DSU in full at all times.

#### L1 Batcher
The first of these trusted contracts would be a wrapping-only batcher contract. This is the lowest hanging fruit and doesnâ€™t rely on a USDC buffer, but still grants a vastly cheaper onboarding experience into DSU.
