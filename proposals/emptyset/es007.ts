const PROPOSAL_TEXT = `# Accept L2 Ownership
## Background
Currently, Empty Set is only deployed on Ethereum L1. With L2â€™s, particularly Arbitrum and Optimism gaining favor, we want to ensure that DSU is natively available on every chain that it may be useful.

We define a structure for DSU to maintain complexity across deployments

  1. Each chain has a separate Reserve and DSU deployment
  2. DSU is owned by its corresponding Reserve
  3. Each Reserve is owned by the L1 DAO through the corresponding bridge
  4. Each Reserve is pausable by a chain-native multisig with equivalent signers to L1

### L2 Deployments
We have deployed DSU and the Reserve on Optimism and Arbitrum mainnets. These use bridged USDC as the unit of account
and a No-Op (held by the Reserve itself) for the depository. This will allow us to get DSU up and running on both
L2s while more research is done on new depositories.

## Accepting Ownership
To make the L2 deployments a verified component of the Empty Set Protocol, the ownership is accepted by the L1
DAO through this proposal. Once executed, the L1 DAO will have all ownership rights over L2 deployments.

## Housekeeping
As part of the TwoWayBatcher deployment, we are deprecating the WrapOnlyBatcher by sending a 'close' transaction to
repay all outstanding debt.
